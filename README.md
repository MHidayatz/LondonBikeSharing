This project is to visualize the london bike ride data with Tableau. 
The dashboard contains:

1. The total number of bike rides.
2. The moving average bike rides base on a timeline chart.
3. A heatmap to display temperature vs Wind Speed base on the selection.

You can view the final dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hidayat.abdul.wahid/viz/LondonBikeRides_16961832335370/LondonBikeSharingDashboard?publish=yes)

The dataset was download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset) using the kaggle API described in notebook.
Next, I used the pandas library to access and manipulate the dataset.
The final dataset is exported called london_bikes_final.
